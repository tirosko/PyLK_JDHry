# Bricks Blaster

Simple arcade-style bricks game using `pygame`.

Run:

```bash
python Bricks/bricks_blaster.py
```

Controls:
- Left/Right arrows: move paddle
- Space: launch ball
- N: next level
- R: restart on Game Over

Gameplay notes:
- Bricks show integer values; hitting a brick reduces its value.
- Destroying a brick may spawn an extra ball (up to a cap).
